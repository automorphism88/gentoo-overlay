# gentoo-overlay
Personal Gentoo overlay, containing a combination of staging ebuilds I'm hoping
to eventually get merged into the official repos, experimental ebuilds that are
too hackish to upstream, and official ebuilds I've modified to reflect my own
preferences.

Packages:

~~app-backup/buttersink  
See https://github.com/AmesCornish/buttersink~~
Removed after being merged into official Portage tree

app-backup/snapper-gui  
See https://github.com/ricardomv/snapper-gui

app-emulation/playonlinux  
Modified from official Gentoo version to accept the new virtual/wine as a
dependency in addition to app-emulation/wine

app-text/calibre  
Gentoo ebuild with USE flags added to toggle system vs bundled
dev-python/beautifulsoup and Gentoo patches removing update dialogs and
disabling plugins. Default behavior is as in official Gentoo ebuild. Also
updated to latest version of calibre more quickly than official Gentoo ebuild.

dev-java/ecj-gcj  
Modified from official Gentoo version to check in $PATH for gcj if it is not
found in the current gcc profile. This allows the package to be built if the
user is using GCC 7+ (or an earlier version without USE=gcj) as the default, so
long as /etc/portage/package.env is used to put a different gcc version with gcj
in the PATH.

games-misc/cowsay  
Modified from Gentoo version to keep upstream default of installing cow files to
/usr/share/cows
